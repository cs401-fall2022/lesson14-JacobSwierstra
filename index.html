<h1>TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers</h1>
    <p>TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. 
        TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional 
        layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.</p>
    <p>For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like string 
        and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently 
        assigned these. TypeScript does.</p>
    <p>This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also 
        TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can 
        highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance 
        of bugs.</p>
    <p>This tutorial provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing 
        on its type system.</p>
<h2>Types by Inference</h2>
        <p>TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate 
            types for you in many cases. For example in creating a 
            variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript 
            will use the value as its type.</p>
