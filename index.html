<h1>TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers</h1>
    <p>TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript.
        TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional
        layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.</p>
    <p>For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like string
        and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently
        assigned these. TypeScript does.</p>
    <p>This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also
        TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can
        highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance
        of bugs.</p>
    <p>This tutorial provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing
        on its type system.</p>
<h2>Types by Inference</h2>
    <p>TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types 
        for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and 
        assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value 
        as its type.</p>
    <p>By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a
        type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. This 
        offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to 
        make types explicit in your code. That’s how TypeScript knows 
        that <code>helloWorld</code> is a <code>string</code> in the 
        above example.</p>
<h2>Defining Types</h2>
    <p>You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript. 
        However, some design patterns make it difficult for types to be 
        inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic 
        programming). To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an 
        extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places for you 
        to tell TypeScript what the types should be.</p>
    <p>For example, to create an object with an inferred type which 
        includes <code>name: string</code> and <code>id: number</code>, 
        you can write:</p>
